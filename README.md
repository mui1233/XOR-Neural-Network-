# XOR-Neural-Network-
An XOR neural network is a network that solves the non-linear XOR logic problem, where the output is 1 if the two inputs are different, and 0 if they are the same. This requires a network with at least one hidden layer and a non-linear activation function, as a single-layer model cannot solve it.
